# Contributing

## Workflow
- Use branches for changes (`feature/...` or `fix/...`)
- Open a Pull Request (PR) into `main`
- Keep PRs small and focused

## Code style
- Python 3.x
- Use clear names, small functions
- If you add a new module, add a short docstring at the top

## Communication
- If you’re unsure, open an Issue first.
- Link PRs to Issues when possible (e.g., "Closes #12").
