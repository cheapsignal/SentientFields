# Assets

Put art/audio/fonts here.

## Suggested subfolders (create when needed)
- `sprites/` (characters, crops, UI icons)
- `tiles/` (ground, paths, water)
- `audio/` (music, SFX)
- `fonts/`

## Rules
- Prefer open-licensed or original assets.
- Name files clearly: `crop_carrot_idle.png`, `ui_button.png`, etc.
- Don’t commit huge raw files if we can avoid it.
